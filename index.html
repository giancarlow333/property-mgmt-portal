                    <q> I used to rent at another building they managed called The Giancarlo, it felt like a resort! Work moved so I had to & property management helped me to find the perfect unit at another one of their properties called, The Custom - Luxury Suites! Such a walkable area. Property management has definitely been the highlight of my stay. Always so resourceful with someone on premesis in case of an urgent matters. Also their website is very usedful and are timely if any requests are in need of being made. After living with carpet for a few years, I made a request to see if property management could clean the carpet or put alternative floors. They ended up putting brand new hardwood floors in my unit at no cost to me. </q> - Lisa Sims,

                    </p><q> I grew up in the area & was always intrigued by the area & amazing views. Crystal Lake Apartments had such beautiful mornings. The team made the apartment complex feel lively. They tell tales that the lake is haunted, but who knows. I still went out for swim to cool down from the heat.  </q> - Freddie Kingston,
