    <h2>Tenant & Landlords Rights & Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>Right to Habitability: Landlords are obligated to provide tenants with safe and habitable living conditions. This includes ensuring that the property meets all health and safety standards, such as adequate plumbing, heating, and sanitation.
                </p>
            <p>Right to Repairs: If there are issues with the rental property that affect habitability, tenants have the right to request repairs in writing. The landlord should address these issues within a reasonable timeframe.
                </p>
            <p> Right to Privacy: Tenants have the right to privacy, and landlords must provide advance notice before entering the rental unit for non-emergency reasons, typically 24 hours in advance.
                </p>
            <p>Rent Control: Some cities in Los Angeles County have rent control ordinances that limit the amount landlords can increase rent and provide additional protections for tenants.
                </p>
            <p>Security Deposits: Landlords can charge a security deposit, but they must follow specific rules, such as providing an itemized list of deductions upon move-out and returning the deposit within a certain timeframe.
                </p>
            <p>Just Cause Evictions: In some areas, landlords can only evict tenants for specific reasons, often referred to as "just cause" reasons. These reasons typically include non-payment of rent, lease violations, or significant damage to the property.
                </p>
            <P>Rent Increases: If the rental property is not subject to rent control, landlords must generally provide a written notice of any rent increases within a specific timeframe before the increase takes effect.
                </p>
            <p> Discrimination: Landlords cannot discriminate against tenants based on factors such as race, color, religion, gender, familial status, national origin, or disability.
                </p>
            <p>Retaliation: Landlords are prohibited from retaliating against tenants who exercise their rights, such as requesting repairs or filing complaints with appropriate authorities.
                </p>
            <p>Please note that these are general guidelines, and specific laws and regulations may vary depending on the city or jurisdiction within Los Angeles County. If you have specific concerns or questions about your rental situation, it's advisable to consult with a local attorney or tenant rights organization for personalized advice.

    <h2>Lease Agreement Clauses</h2>
            <p>The rules and regulations for living in an apartment unit can vary depending on the specific apartment complex, property management company, or landlord. However, some common rules and guidelines typically apply to most apartment living situations. Keep in mind that this is a general overview, and you should always refer to the lease agreement and any specific rules provided by your landlord or property management for accurate information. 
                </p>
                
            <p>Rent Payment: Pay your rent on time, usually monthly, and through the agreed-upon payment method.
                </p>
            <p>Lease Agreement: Abide by the terms of your lease agreement, including the duration of the lease, occupancy limits, and any specific rules mentioned.
                </p>
            <p>Noise: Keep noise levels at a reasonable level to avoid disturbing your neighbors. Quiet hours may be specified, usually during nighttime hours.
                </p>
            <p>Pets: If pets are allowed, adhere to pet policies, such as leash rules, cleaning up after your pet, and paying any necessary pet fees or deposits.
                </p>
            <p>Smoking: Follow the designated smoking areas or non-smoking policies, which may include restrictions on smoking inside the apartment or on balconies.
                </p>
            <p>Maintenance and Repairs: Report any maintenance issues or repairs promptly, and cooperate with maintenance staff to access your unit when needed.
                </p>
            <p>Alterations: Seek permission from the landlord before making any significant alterations or modifications to the apartment.
                </p>
            <p>Trash and Recycling: Dispose of trash and recycling properly in designated areas.
                </p>
            <p>Parking: Follow parking rules and use designated parking spaces, if applicable.
                </p>
            <p>Guests: Be mindful of the number of guests you have and their behavior, as you are responsible for their conduct while on the property.
                </p>
            <p>Subletting and Airbnb: If subletting or short-term rentals are allowed, follow the proper procedures and inform the landlord if you plan to do so.
                </p>
            <p>Security and Safety: Comply with any security measures, such as locking doors and windows, to maintain a safe living environment.
                </p>
            <P>Common Areas: Respect shared/common areas and follow any rules specific to those spaces.
                </p>
            <p>Insurance: Consider getting renters' insurance to protect your personal belongings, as the landlord's insurance typically does not cover your possessions.
                </p>
            <p>Entry Access: Allow entry to the apartment for necessary inspections or repairs with proper notice, as required by local laws.
                </p>
            <p>Utilities: Pay your utility bills promptly, if they are not included in the rent.
            </p>
<p>It's crucial to familiarize yourself with these rules and any additional regulations provided in the lease agreement before moving into an apartment unit. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to clarify with the landlord or property management. Remember, respecting the rules will help foster a peaceful living environment and good relations with your neighbors and property management.
